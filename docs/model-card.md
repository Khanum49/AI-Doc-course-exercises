# Task Description

Choose a publicly available model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) or [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/models-datasets). Create a model card for it, filling in any missing information with reasonable assumptions.

Model Chosen: [CodeTrans model for code documentation generation go](https://huggingface.co/SEBIS/code_trans_t5_base_code_documentation_generation_go)

# Model Card: 

## [CodeTrans model for code documentation generation go]

    ## Model Details
    - Developer: Ahmed Elnaggar & Wei Dang
    - Model Date/Last Updated: Jun 23, 2021
    - Model Version/Latest Commit: f350896
    - Model Type: T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
    - License: MIT

    ## Intended Use
    - Primary Intended Uses: Generate natural language descriptions for Go functions
    - Primary Intended Users: Software engineers, Code documentation tools, Researchers
      working on code summarization
    - Out-of-Scope Uses: Not intended for non-Go programming languages or general-purpose text
      generation outside of code summarization

    ## Factors
    - Relevant Factors: Input format (tokenized vs. untokenized Go code), function complexity
      programming style
    - Evaluation Factors: Evaluated on tokenized vs. untokenized input; assessed on
      function-level summarization quality

    ## Metrics
    - Model Performance Measures: BLEU scores reported for code documentation tasks across
      different programming languages
    - Decision Thresholds: Not applicable, the model outputs a documentation string for every
      input function without a classification or filtering threshold.
    - Variation Approaches: Performance may vary significantly depending on whether the code
      is tokenized or unparsed; tokenized inputs yield higher BLEU scores.

    ## Evaluation Data
    - Datasets: CodeSearchNet corpus (Go subset)
    - Motivation: Large-scale dataset with aligned code-docstring pairs for supervised training
    - Preprocessing: Filtered incomplete examples, tokenized Go functions for more consistent
      model input

    ## Training Data
    - Datasets: CodeSearchNet (Go)
    - Motivation: Rich, open-source dataset containing real-world Go code and human-written
      documentation
    - Preprocessing: Used a custom tokenizer; removed duplicates and cleaned docstrings for
      noise reduction

    ## Ethical Considerations
    - Model may reinforce poor or outdated coding patterns present in open-source datasets  
    - Generated documentation may not always be correct or safe for production without human validation  
    - Training data includes only publicly available code; no personal or private data is used  

    ## Caveats and Recommendations
    - Model performs best on tokenized, single-function Go code  
    - Not optimized for summarizing large, multi-function files  
    - May generate incomplete or inaccurate descriptions for edge-case logic  
    - Recommended for use in developer tools with human-in-the-loop validation  
    - For production use, additional fine-tuning may be necessary on domain-specific datasets
