# AI Documentation Exercises Portfolio

Welcome to my curated collection of hands-on documentation exercises based on the exercises in the [AI Documentation Course](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/aimldocumentation/) by [Being Technical Writer](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/).

These are focused on real-world AI and machine learning systems. This repository demonstrates how technical documentation can be structured around user needs, use-case clarity, and ML transparency.

**Goal:** To showcase my skills as a technical writer by translating complex AI/ML topics into accessible, structured, and user-centric documentation.

## Contents

### 1. [Lung Nodule Detection – Persona-Driven Documentation](./user-needs-doc.md)

- **Use Case:** Medical image classification for early lung cancer detection
- **Focus:** User personas (radiologists, doctors, researchers) and their documentation needs

### 2. [Fraud Detection – ML Approach Analysis](./identify-ML.md)
- **Use Case:** Financial transaction fraud detection
- **Focus:** Learning type, data needs, and explainability challenges
- **Documentation Insight:** What’s hard to explain to stakeholders

### 3. [Model Card for an AI model](./model-card.md)

### 4. [A Layered Documentation Plan](./layered-doc.md)

### 5. [Tailor the Technical Concepts to Different Audiences](./different-audience.md)

## Why This Repo?

Creating effective AI documentation goes beyond writing about models — it's about understanding:
- Who the users are
- What questions they’ll ask
- How to communicate ML logic responsibly and clearly

This repo is a space to practice and demonstrate exactly that.


## Tools Used
- Markdown
- Git & GitHub
- Persona mapping techniques
- AI/ML domain knowledge (image processing, fraud detection)
